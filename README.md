# Protein Evolution Simulator

- Assignment completed in T3 2022 for BINF3020: Computational Bioinformatics
- Task was to create an amino acid evolution simulator that simulated 500 rounds of evolution, with the pre-supplied mutation matrix.
- Project Spec can be found in `spec.html`.
- A final mark of 82.9/100 (5.8/7) was awarded and was worth 7% of final grade.

## Example Usage

With a fasta file `s0` containting initial amino acid sequence, and `s501` containing output:
```sh
python3 evolve < s0 > s501
```
